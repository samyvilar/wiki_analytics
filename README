Wiki Stats

Simple application that tracks random paths the either lead to philosophy/dead end/ or cycle
Starting from a random wiki article see: @http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

Currently simply counts the paths, average length of all those that lead to philosophy
and the distribution (as percentage) of each explored path.

NOTE: it doesn't keep track of seen paths, it is possible that the same path may be explored twice.

requires, lxml for parsing and
          bottle to serve the actual objects.

The server is singlethreaded, with a single background thread collecting stats.

usage:
    $ ./wiki_analytics.py --help # print usage

    $ ./wiki_analytics.py &  # <<<< runs the server in the background.
    $ curl localhost:8080 # get current stats as a json object.
    $ kill `pgrep -f wiki_analytics.py` # Kills background server insta
