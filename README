Wiki Stats

Simple application that tracks random paths the either lead to philosophy/dead end/ or cycle
Starting from a random wiki article see: @http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

Currently simply counts the paths, average length of all those that lead to philosophy
and the distribution (as percentage) of each explored path.

NOTE: it doesn't keep track of seen paths, it is possible that the same path may be explored twice.
