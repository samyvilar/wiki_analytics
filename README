Wiki Stats

Simple application that tracks statistics on paths 
from random wiki articles that either 
terminate at philosophy/dead end or cycle

see: @http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

Currently:
- counts the type of paths (philosophy, dead end, cycled)
- average length of all those that lead to philosophy
and the distribution (as percentage) of each explored path.

NOTE: it doesn't keep track of seen paths, 
it is possible that the same path may be explored twice.

requires, lxml for parsing and
          bottle to serve the actual objects.

The server is singlethreaded, with a single background thread collecting stats.

usage:
    $ ./wiki_analytics.py --help # print usage

    $ ./wiki_analytics.py &  # <<<< runs the server in the background.
    $ curl localhost:8080 # get current stats as a json object.
    $ kill `pgrep -f wiki_analytics.py` # Kills background server insta
