Wiki Stats

Simple application that tracks statistics on the articles
traversed from random wiki article to philosophy,
on exit the current stats are saved, which are reloaded 
on restart.

see: @http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

Currently:
- average number of hops to philosophy
- distribution (as percentage) of the different kind of routes.
(philosophy, cycled, dead end [no links] present, exception bad link)

NOTE: it doesn't keep track of seen routes, 
it is possible that the same sequence may be counted twice.

requires, lxml for parsing and
          bottle to serve the actual objects.

The server has a single background thread collecting stats.

usage:
    $ ./wiki_analytics.py --help # print usage
    $ ./wiki_analytics.py # <<<< starts the server and continuously gather stats 
    In another shell
    $ curl localhost:8080 # get current stats as a json object.

    $ [ctrl-c] # save stats kill server 
    $ kill `pgrep -f wiki_analytics.py` # <<<< unsafe!! May raise segfault due to to lxml c code and would probably not save stats
